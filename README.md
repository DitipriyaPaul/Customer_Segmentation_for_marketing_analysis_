# Customer_Segmentation_for_marketing_analysis_
This project aims to perform customer segmentation on a Mall customer dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal of this project is to cluster the customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.
By employing the K-Means clustering technique, we have effectively partitioned the data into various subgroups, predicated upon a diversity of distinct features. Subsequently, the management of the mall is able to effectively concentrate their efforts on particular clusters that possess an average spending score, with the objective of maximising the overall profitability.
